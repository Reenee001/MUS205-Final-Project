# MUS205-Final-Project
An interactive Christmas scene where users can explore and interact with various houses in the town. Clicking on a house transports the user into an animated living room filled with interactive Christmas elements.

First Draft: So far we have the interactive image for our first scene where when you click on the door it'll bring you to the next scene -- the living room. We accomplished this by making a color detecting function where when your mouse is over the specific brown of the door (which we edited the image to ensure the doors would be a solid brown color unique to the doors) and click, it'll move you to the next scene.

In addition we added clouds to the scene and we are currently implementing a 'click-to-snow' feature to the clouds.
Accomplished through adding a Cloud class.

We have also started to add our audio files which we will implement soon.

As for the living room, we had to manually re-size and extend the image as it wasn't horrizontal enough so we did that manually by drawing in the background on a third party app.

🔹 1. Ideation Phase
How did the idea emerge?
We got the idea to do a Christmas Scenary Project as the holiday seasons were coming up and wanted to do a festive interactive scene.
Each interactive idea came from thinking about the elements present in the scene and how we can make it more interactive. For example, we knew that to complete a Christmas scene, we would need a christmas tree so we thought of how we can make that interactive and we settled on decorating it with ornaments. In addition, we wanted to add sound interactivity so we wanted a radio that you can play music from. And we just kept coming up with more things to add. 

What artistic/technical goals guided your early thinking?
Since many of us in this group are begginer coders, we also stuck with ideas that were within our skill sets (things we've done in class before that we knew we can replicate). This is also why we settled on the 2 scenes thing, boucing off the idea of the interactive storytelling class we had. Then we also took skills from the making-an-image-interactive class to get the idea to detect the door for us to enter to the next scene rather than just clicking 1 or 2. Also the particle effects for our own effects.
